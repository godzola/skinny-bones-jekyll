### Q: What Are Congenital Heart Defects?

### A: Congenital heart defects are problems with the heart's structure that are present at birth.

These defects can involve:

- The interior walls of the heart 
- The valves inside the heart 
- The arteries and veins that carry blood to the heart or the body 

Though research is ongoing, at least 35 defects have now been identified.

			Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) is the #1 birth defect and also the #1 cause of birth defect related deaths. About 1 out of every 100 babies is born each year with some type of CHD. This year approximately 4,000 babies will not live to see their first birthday because of CHD.

		<td style="width: 35%;">
			It is also a proven fact that the earlier CHD is detected and treated, it is more likely the affected child will survive and have fewer long term health complications. Although some babies will be diagnosed during gestation or at birth, sometimes the diagnosis is not made until days, weeks, months, or even years after. In some cases,CHD is not detected until adolescence or adulthood.

Nearly twice as many children die from CHD in the United States each year as from all forms of childhood cancers combined, yet funding for pediatric cancer research is five times higher than funding for CHD. Of every dollar the U.S. government spends on medical funding only a fraction of a penny is directed toward Congenital Heart Defect research.
