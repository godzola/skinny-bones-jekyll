I’m helping the CHD Coalition and you can too! By clicking on the **donate now** button below, **_or any other donate now button on this site_** you will be able to donate money to CHD for heart bags. These heart bags will be given to kids with congenital heart disease who will soon be  going into surgery in the NJ\NY area. These heart bags will be filled with individualized gifts like two gift cards, coloring books, journals, a water bottle, and some other goodies to help them get through the surgery and make their recovery easier.

			After we’ve raised the money for these bags my family and I will go and assemble these heart bags and deliver them to the kids in the hospital. If we raise more money than we need for the heart bags alone, we will donate the rest for funding for research in specific hospitals that the CHD Coalition works with. 

			Thank you to everyone who donated, it really means a lot to me and everyone working for the CHD Coalition. Your donation has just put a smile on a kids face!
