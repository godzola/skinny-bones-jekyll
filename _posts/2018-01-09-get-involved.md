Here's one way you can help - besides volunteering or donating time and money to someone who needs it in your local area - which is always a good thing.

I started an event to raise money for the [heart bag program](http://chdcoalition.org/programs/hospital-relations) that CHD Coalitions runs.  You can visit the CHD Coalition site and read more about the heart bag program and look at some families' testimonials. 


> Our most important goal is to bring hope to the
> family and to the CHD survivor currently hospitalized.
> To let them know that they are not alone and that a 
> large community of Heart Families is readily available
> to offer support ... (the) Heart Bag program is another
> way we deliver this message of hope. Our Heart Bags 
> contain numerous items that may make the familyâ€™s 
> stay within the hospital a little easier.

This is a big deal for families and kids that you probably know by name. Thanks for taking the time to read through my site and doing something - please donate now and be that person who put a smile on a kid's face.
