<p>Hi my name is Mira Zola, I’m in 7th grade, and I’m having my Bat mitzvah in May of 2018. A few of my hobbies are rock climbing, reading and collecting MAD magazines and traveling.</p>

<p>I was born with a bicuspid aortic valve, a mutation of the aortic valve in your heart, and have been seeing a Cardiologist since I was 4 years old. Even though I’m enjoying my life in a healthy state, there are many kids out there with heart issues who can’t experience a lot of the things I have because of the severity of their heart defects. So, for my bat mitzvah project, I decided to give back to kids who do have much more severe heart conditions than I do.
